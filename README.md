# tsk - work with a clear context
tsk is about tasks. Big and small. From working out your next sequence of moves in the codebase to planning 
large scale cross team initiatives.

It is also designed from the ground up to work in the world of agentic engineering. With a native MCP you can have tsk 
running alongside your agent and keep track of where you both are, or where youre *teams* of agents are for that matter. Or even where you, your human colleagues and their agents are!

It's your "sat nav" for work. Keep your human cognitive context and that of your agents clear and keep track of all the work threads you are context switching to.

## The foundations

At the core of the domain of tsk are four dimensions which are facets of any software engineering delivery. Where tsk 
is different is that it models all four of these dimensions explicitly. Other tools you might be used to like linear or jira 
only model some parts of these dimensions, and end up being a little too abstract (in the wrong direction) to really give
 a holistic abstraction.

tsk is very opinionated but within a very specific abstraction. It has a lot of flexibility but in the right dimensions.

The four dimensions are:

- Navigation
- Deltas
- Product
- Scale
