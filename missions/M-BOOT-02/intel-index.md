# M-BOOT-02: intelligence index

All intelligence for M-BOOT-02 (harness), gathered in one file for now. Split into
topic files here once this grows unwieldy.

- `docs/domain/mission-briefing-template.md` (in the tsk repo): the briefing format, with tsk and harness fields
  marked
- `docs/` in the tsk repo, produced by M-BOOT-01
- Claude Code cloud environment documentation
- Cloud sessions clone the repo. Repo `.claude/` files transfer with it. User level
  `~/.claude` files do not, which is why T-01 exists.
- Transcripts are JSONL at `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-dir>/<sessionId>.jsonl`
- Threads hold their own context and can be paused, suspended and resumed. Thread state
  is tsk domain, because the next session may be a different actor. A run record is
  ksobr domain and retrospective. They are two artefacts, not one.
- The plan format's Checkpoint section and `What's Next` pointer are thread state in
  Jim's current practice
- Setup script filesystem output is cached per environment, not per session
- Plugins declared in `.claude/settings.json` are recognised, not installed. An
  unattended session has nobody to accept an install prompt, so the setup script must
  install them explicitly.
- `cargo` and `rustc` are pre-installed on Anthropic-hosted cloud sessions, part of the
  base VM image rather than anything an environment's setup script installs. Confirmed
  2026-09-15: `~/.rustup/settings.toml` carries a March 2026 timestamp, months older than
  the setup-script cache's roughly seven-day expiry, and no `dpkg` entry for `cargo` or
  `rustc` exists, ruling out both an environment setup script and an `apt` install.
- `tsk-bin` and `tsk-core` are already published on crates.io (`0.1.7` as of 2026-04-01).
  The general harness's session init can install tsk with `cargo install tsk-bin` rather
  than building from source or fetching a GitHub release binary. Cost is small (~30s from
  a clean build), so it fits a `SessionStart` hook rather than needing setup-script
  caching. Note the local checkout is ahead of the published crate, at workspace version
  `0.2.0`.
- Cloud environment setup scripts are configured from the web (claude.ai/code) or the
  Desktop app only. The iOS/mobile app selects an existing environment but has no UI to
  create or edit one.
- SessionStart hook confirmed working in a session with only `tsk` attached (2026-09-15):
  `$TSK_BOOTSTRAP_WT` set correctly, resolving the open question left by the prior
  session's cross-repo failure (cwd above both `tsk` and `tsk-nexus`, so
  `tsk/.claude/settings.json` never loaded).
- `tsk` has no prebuilt binary on `PATH` by default; building from source or
  `cargo install` is required.
- tsk is the only repo running this harness for now, so the harness can rely on paths in
  the tsk repo itself, `docs/domain/` included, rather than carrying its own copies.
  This assumption ends the first time another repo installs the harness.
